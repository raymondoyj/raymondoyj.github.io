# Introduction

OGNL stands for **O**bject **G**raph **N**avigation **L**anguage. It is
an expression and binding language for getting and setting properties of
Java objects. Normally the same expression is used for both getting and
setting the value of a property.

We pronounce OGNL as a word, like the last syllables of a drunken
pronunciation of "orthogonal."

Many people have asked exactly what OGNL is good for. Several of the
uses to which OGNL has been applied are:

- A binding language between GUI elements (textfield, combobox, etc.)
  to model objects. Transformations are made easier by OGNL's
  TypeConverter mechanism to convert values from one type to another
  (String to numeric types, for example).
- A data source language to map between table columns and a Swing
  TableModel.
- A binding language between web components and the underlying model
  objects ([WebOGNL](http://www.ognl.org),
  [Tapestry](http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/index.html),
  [WebWork](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensymphony),
  [WebObjects](http://wonder.sourceforge.net/index.html)).
- A more expressive replacement for the property-getting language used
  by the Jakarta Commons BeanUtils package or JSTL's EL (which only
  allow simple property navigation and rudimentary indexed
  properties).

Most of what you can do in Java is possible in OGNL, plus other extras
such as list [projection](#projecting-across-collections) and [selection](#selecting-from-collections) and
[lambda expressions](#pseudo-lambda-expressions).

## History

OGNL started out as a way to set up associations between UI components
and controllers using property names. As the desire for more complicated
associations grew, Drew Davidson created what he called KVCL, for
Key-Value Coding Language, egged on by Luke Blanshard. Luke then
reimplemented the language using ANTLR, came up with the new name, and,
egged on by Drew, filled it out to its current state. Later on Luke
again reimplemented the language using
[JavaCC](http://www.webgain.com/products/java_cc/). Further maintenance
on all the code is done by Drew (with spiritual guidance from Luke).

## Syntax

Simple OGNL expressions are very simple. The language has become quite
rich with features, but you don't generally need to worry about the more
complicated parts of the language: the simple cases have remained that
way. For example, to get at the name property of an object, the OGNL
expression is simply name. To get at the text property of the object
returned by the headline property, the OGNL expression is headline.text.

What is a property? Roughly, an OGNL property is the same as a bean
property, which means that a pair of get/set methods, or alternatively a
field, defines a property (the full story is a bit more complicated,
since properties differ for different kinds of objects; see below for a
full explanation).

The fundamental unit of an OGNL expression is the navigation chain,
usually just called "chain." The simplest chains consist of the
following parts:

|Expression Element Part|Example|
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Property names|like the name and headline.text examples above|
|Method Calls|hashCode() to return the current object's hash code|
|Array Indices|listeners[0] to return the first of the current object's list of listeners|

All OGNL expressions are evaluated in the context of a current object,
and a chain simply uses the result of the previous link in the chain as
the current object for the next one. You can extend a chain as long as
you like. For example, this chain:

```
    name.toCharArray()[0].numericValue.toString()
```

This expression follows these steps to evaluate:

- extracts the name property of the initial, or root, object (which
  the user provides to OGNL through the OGNL context)
- calls the toCharArray() method on the resulting `String`
- extracts the first character (the one at index 0) from the resulting
  array
- gets the numericValue property from that character (the character is
  represented as a `Character` object, and the `Character` class has a
  method called getNumericValue()).
- calls toString() on the resulting `Integer` object. The final result
  of this expression is the `String` returned by the last toString()
  call.

Note that this example can only be used to get a value from an object,
not to set a value. Passing the above expression to the Ognl.setValue()
method would cause an `InappropriateExpressionException` to be thrown,
because the last link in the chain is neither a property name nor an
array index.

This is enough syntax to do the vast majority of what you ever need to
do.

## Expressions

This section outlines the details the elements of OGNL's expressions.

## Constants

OGNL has the following kinds of constants:

- String literals, as in Java (with the addition of single quotes):
  delimited by single- or double-quotes, with the full set of
  character escapes.
- Character literals, also as in Java: delimited by single-quotes,
  also with the full set of escapes.
- Numeric literals, with a few more kinds than Java. In addition to
  Java's ints, longs, floats and doubles, OGNL lets you specify
  BigDecimals with a "b" or "B" suffix, and BigIntegers with an "h" or
  "H" suffix (think "huge"---we chose "h" for BigIntegers because it
  does not interfere with hexadecimal digits).
- Boolean `(true` and `false`) literals.
- The `null` literal.

## Referring to Properties

OGNL treats different kinds of objects differently in its handling of
property references. Maps treat all property references as element
lookups or storage, with the property name as the key. Lists and arrays
treat numeric properties similarly, with the property name as the index,
but string properties the same way ordinary objects do. Ordinary objects
(that is, all other kinds) only can handle string properties and do so
by using "get" and "set" methods (or "is" and "set"), if the object has
them, or a field with the given name otherwise.

Note the new terminology here. Property "names" can be of any type, not
just Strings. But to refer to non-String properties, you must use what
we have been calling the "index" notation. For example, to get the
length of an array, you can use this expression:

    array.length

But to get at element 0 of the array, you must use an expression like
this:

    array[0]

Note that Java collections have some special properties associated with
them. See [Pseudo-Properties for Collections](#pseudo-properties-for-collections) for these
properties.

## Indexing

As discussed above, the "indexing" notation is actually just property
reference, though a computed form of property reference rather than a
constant one.

For example, OGNL internally treats the "array.length" expression
exactly the same as this expression:

    array["length"]

And this expression would have the same result (though not the same
internal form):

    array["len" + "gth"]

### Array and List Indexing

For Java arrays and Lists indexing is fairly simple, just like in Java.
An integer index is given and that element is the referrent. If the
index is out of bounds of the array or List and
IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown, just as in Java.

### JavaBeans Indexed Properties

JavaBeans supports the concept of Indexed properties. Specifically this
means that an object has a set of methods that follow the following
pattern:

- public PropertyType[] getPropertyName()
- public void setPropertyName(PropertyType[] anArray)
- public PropertyType getPropertyName(int index)
- public void setPropertyName(int index, PropertyType value)

OGNL can interpret this and provide seamless access to the property
through the indexing notation. References such as

    someProperty[2]

are automatically routed through the correct indexed property accessor
(in the above case through `getSomeProperty(2)` or
`setSomeProperty(2, value)`). If there is no indexed property accessor a
property is found with the name `someProperty` and the index is applied
to that.

### OGNL Object Indexed Properties

OGNL extends the concept of indexed properties to include indexing with
arbitrary objects, not just integers as with JavaBeans Indexed
Properties. When finding properties as candidates for object indexing,
OGNL looks for patterns of methods with the following signature:

- public PropertyType getPropertyName(IndexType index)
- public void setPropertyName(IndexType index, PropertyType value)

The PropertyType and IndexType must match each other in the
corresponding set and get methods. An actual example of using Object
Indexed Properties is with the Servlet API: the Session object has two
methods for getting and setting arbitrary attributes:

    public Object getAttribute(String name) public void setAttribute(String name, Object value)

An OGNL expression that can both get and set one of these attributes is

    session.attribute["foo"]

## Calling Methods

OGNL calls methods a little differently from the way Java does, because
OGNL is interpreted and must choose the right method at run time, with
no extra type information aside from the actual arguments supplied. OGNL
always chooses the most specific method it can find whose types match
the supplied arguments; if there are two or more methods that are
equally specific and match the given arguments, one of them will be
chosen arbitrarily.

In particular, a null argument matches all non-primitive types, and so
is most likely to result in an unexpected method being called.

Note that the arguments to a method are separated by commas, and so the
comma operator cannot be used unless it is enclosed in parentheses. For
example,

    method( ensureLoaded(), name )

is a call to a 2-argument method, while

    method( (ensureLoaded(), name) )

is a call to a 1-argument method.

## Variable References

OGNL has a simple variable scheme, which lets you store intermediate
results and use them again, or just name things to make an expression
easier to understand. All variables in OGNL are global to the entire
expression. You refer to a variable using a number sign in front of its
name, like this:

    #var

OGNL also stores the current object at every point in the evaluation of
an expression in the this variable, where it can be referred to like any
other variable. For example, the following expression operates on the
number of listeners, returning twice the number if it is more than 100,
or 20 more than the number otherwise:

    listeners.size().(#this > 100? 2*#this : 20+#this)

OGNL can be invoked with a map that defines initial values for
variables. The standard way of invoking OGNL defines the variables
`root` (which holds the initial, or root, object), and `context` (which
holds the `Map` of variables itself).

To assign a value to a variable explicitly, simply write an assignment
statement with a variable reference on the left-hand side:

    #var = 99

## Parenthetical Expressions

As you would expect, an expression enclosed in parentheses is evaluated
as a unit, separately from any surrounding operators. This can be used
to force an evaluation order different from the one that would be
implied by OGNL operator precedences. It is also the only way to use the
comma operator in a method argument.

## Chained Subexpressions

If you use a parenthetical expression after a dot, the object that is
current at the dot is used as the current object throughout the
parenthetical expression. For example,

    headline.parent.(ensureLoaded(), name)

traverses through the headline and parent properties, ensures that the
parent is loaded and then returns (or sets) the parent's name.

Top-level expressions can also be chained in this way. The result of the
expression is the right-most expression element.

    ensureLoaded(), name

This will call `ensureLoaded()` on the root object, then get the name
property of the root object as the result of the expression.

## Collection Construction

### Lists

To create a list of objects, enclose a list of expressions in curly
braces. As with method arguments, these expressions cannot use the comma
operator unless it is enclosed in parentheses. Here is an example:

    name in { null,"Untitled" }

This tests whether the `name` property is `null` or equal to
`"Untitled"`.

The syntax described above will create a instanceof the `List`
interface. The exact subclass is not defined.

### Native Arrays

Sometimes you want to create Java native arrays, such as `int[]` or
`Integer[]`. OGNL supports the creation of these similarly to the way
that constructors are normally called, but allows initialization of the
native array from either an existing list or a given size of the array.

    new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }

This creates a new `int` array consisting of three integers 1, 2 and 3.

To create an array with all `null` or `0` elements, use the alternative
size constructor

    new int[5]

This creates an `int` array with 5 slots, all initialized to zero.

### Maps

Maps can also be created using a special syntax.

    #{ "foo" : "foo value", "bar" : "bar value" }

This creates a Map initialized with mappings for `"foo"` and `"bar"`.

Advanced users who wish to select the specific Map class can specify
that class before the opening curly brace

    #@java.util.LinkedHashMap@{ "foo" : "foo value", "bar" : "bar value" }

The above example will create an instance of the JDK 1.4 class
`LinkedHashMap`, ensuring the the insertion order of the elements is
preserved.

## Projecting Across Collections

OGNL provides a simple way to call the same method or extract the same
property from each element in a collection and store the results in a
new collection. We call this "projection," from the database term for
choosing a subset of columns from a table. For example, this expression:

    listeners.{delegate}

returns a list of all the listeners' delegates. See the coercion section
for how OGNL treats various kinds of objects as collections.

During a projection the `#this` variable refers to the current element
of the iteration.

    objects.{ #this instanceof String ? #this : #this.toString()}

The above would produce a new list of elements from the objects list as
string values.

## Selecting From Collections

OGNL provides a simple way to use an expression to choose some elements
from a collection and save the results in a new collection. We call this
"selection," from the database term for choosing a subset of rows from a
table. For example, this expression:

    listeners.{? #this instanceof ActionListener}

returns a list of all those listeners that are instances of the
`ActionListener` class. See the [operators](#operators) for
how OGNL treats various kinds of objects as collections.

### Selecting First Match

In order to get the first match from a list of matches, you could use
indexing such as `listeners.{? true }[0]`. However, this is cumbersome
because if the match does not return any results (or if the result list
is empty) you will get an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The selection syntax is also available to select only the first match
and return it as a list. If the match does not succeed for any elements
an empty list is the result.

    objects.{^ #this instanceof String }

Will return the first element contained in objects that is an instance
of the `String` class.

### Selecting Last Match

Similar to getting the first match, sometimes you want to get the last
element that matched.

    objects.{$ #this instanceof String }

This will return the last element contained in objects that is an
instanceof the `String` class

## Calling Constructors

You can create new objects as in Java, with the `new` operator. One
difference is that you must specify the fully qualified class name for
classes other than those in the java.lang package.[^1] (for example,
`new java.util.ArrayList()`, rather than simply `new ArrayList()`).

OGNL chooses the right constructor to call using the same procedure it
uses for overloaded method calls.

## Calling Static Methods

You can call a static method using the syntax
`@``class``@``method(args)`. If you leave out class, it defaults to
`java.lang.Math`, to make it easier to call `min` and `max` methods. If
you specify the class, you must give the fully qualified name.

If you have an instance of a class whose static method you wish to call,
you can call the method through the object as if it was an instance
method.

If the method name is overloaded, OGNL chooses the right static method
to call using the same procedure it uses for overloaded instance
methods.

## Getting Static Fields

You can refer to a static field using the syntax `@``class``@``field`.
The class must be fully qualified.

## Expression Evaluation

If you follow an OGNL expression with a parenthesized expression,
without a dot in front of the parentheses, OGNL will try to treat the
result of the first expression as another expression to evaluate, and
will use the result of the parenthesized expression as the root object
for that evaluation. The result of the first expression may be any
object; if it is an AST, OGNL assumes it is the parsed form of an
expression and simply interprets it; otherwise, OGNL takes the string
value of the object and parses that string to get the AST to interpret.

For example, this expression

    #fact(30H)

looks up the fact variable, and interprets the value of that variable as
an OGNL expression using the `BigInteger` representation of `30` as the
root object. See below for an example of setting the `fact` variable
with an expression that returns the factorial of its argument. Note that
there is an ambiguity in OGNL's syntax between this double evaluation
operator and a method call. OGNL resolves this ambiguity by calling
anything that looks like a method call, a method call. For example, if
the current object had a fact property that held an OGNL factorial
expression, you could not use this approach to call it

    fact(30H)

because OGNL would interpret this as a call to the fact method. You
could force the interpretation you want by surrounding the property
reference by parentheses:

    (fact)(30H)

## Pseudo-Lambda Expressions

OGNL has a simplified lambda-expression syntax, which lets you write
simple functions. It is not a full-blown lambda calculus, because there
are no closures---all variables in OGNL have global scope and extent.

For example, here is an OGNL expression that declares a recursive
factorial function, and then calls it:

    #fact = :[#this<=1? 1 : #this*#fact(#this-1)], #fact(30H)

The lambda expression is everything inside the brackets. The \#this
variable holds the argument to the expression, which is initially `30H`,
and is then one less for each successive call to the expression.

OGNL treats lambda expressions as constants. The value of a lambda
expression is the AST that OGNL uses as the parsed form of the contained
expression.

## Pseudo-Properties for Collections

There are some special properties of collections that OGNL makes
available. The reason for this is that the collections do not follow
JavaBeans patterns for method naming; therefore the `size()`,
`length()`, etc. methods must be called instead of more intuitively
referring to these as properties. OGNL corrects this by exposing certain
pseudo-properties as if they were built-in.

|Collection                                       |Special Properties                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`Collection` (inherited by `Map`, `List` & `Set`)|`size` - The size of the collection|
|                                                 |`isEmpty` - Evaluates to `true` if the collection is empty|
|`List`                                           |`iterator` - Evaluates to an `Iterator` over the `List`.|
|`Map`                                            |`keys` - Evaluates to a `Set` of all keys in the `Map`.|
|                                                 |`values` - Evaluates to a `Collection` of all values in the `Map`.|
|                                                 |> **Note** These properties, plus `size` and `isEmpty`, are different than the indexed form of access for `Map`s (i.e. `someMap["size"]` gets the `"size"` key from the map, whereas `someMap.size` gets the size of the `Map`.|
|`Set`                                            |`iterator` - Evaluates to an `Iterator` over the `Set`.|
|`Iterator`                                       |`next` - Evaluates to the next object from the `Iterator`.|
|                                                 |`hasNext` - Evaluates to `true` if there is a next object available from the `Iterator`.|
|`Enumeration`                                    |`next` - Evaluates to the next object from the `Enumeration`.|
|                                                 |`hasNext` - Evaluates to `true` if there is a next object available from the `Enumeration`.|
|                                                 |`nextElement` - Synonym for `next`.|
|                                                 |`hasMoreElements` - Synonym for `hasNext`.|
                                                      
## Operators that differ from Java's operators

For the most part, OGNL's operators are borrowed from Java and work
similarly to Java's operators. See the OGNL Reference for a complete
discussion. Here we describe OGNL operators that are not in Java, or
that are different from Java.

- The comma (,) or sequence operator. This operator is borrowed
  from C. The comma is used to separate two independent expressions.
  The value of the second of these expressions is the value of the
  comma expression. Here is an example:
```
ensureLoaded(), name
```
  When this expression is evaluated, the ensureLoaded method is called
  (presumably to make sure that all parts of the object are in
  memory), then the name property is retrieved (if getting the value)
  or replaced (if setting).
- List construction with curly braces ({}). You can create a list
  in-line by enclosing the values in curly braces, as in this example:
```
{ null, true, false }
```
- The `in` operator (and `not in`, its negation). This is a
  containment test, to see if a value is in a collection. For example,
```
name in {null,"Untitled"} || name
```
- See the OGNL reference for a full list of operations

## Setting values versus getting values

As stated before, some values that are gettable are not also settable
because of the nature of the expression. For example,

    names[0].location

is a settable expression - the final component of the expression
resolves to a settable property.

However, some expressions, such as

    names[0].length + 1

are not settable because they do not resolve to a settable property in
an object. It is simply a computed value. If you try to evaluate this
expression using any of the `Ognl.setValue()` methods it will fail with
an `InappropriateExpressionException`.

It is also possible to set variables using get expressions that include
the '`=`' operator. This is useful when a get expression needs to set a
variable as a side effect of execution.

## Coercing Objects to Types

Here we describe how OGNL interprets objects as various types. See below
for how OGNL coerces objects to booleans, numbers, integers, and
collections.

## Interpreting Objects as Booleans

Any object can be used where a boolean is required. OGNL interprets
objects as booleans like this:

- If the object is a `Boolean`, its value is extracted and returned
- If the object is a `Number`, its double-precision floating-point
  value is compared with zero; non-zero is treated as `true`, zero as
  `false`.
- If the object is a `Character`, its boolean value is `true` if and
  only if its char value is non-zero.
- Otherwise, its boolean value is `true` if and only if it is
  non-`null`.

## Interpreting Objects as Numbers

Numerical operators try to treat their arguments as numbers. The basic
primitive-type wrapper classes (Integer, Double, and so on, including
Character and Boolean, which are treated as integers), and the "big"
numeric classes from the java.math package (BigInteger and BigDecimal),
are recognized as special numeric types. Given an object of some other
class, OGNL tries to parse the object's string value as a number.

Numerical operators that take two arguments use the following algorithm
to decide what type the result should be. The type of the actual result
may be wider, if the result does not fit in the given type.

- If both arguments are of the same type, the result will be of the
  same type if possible.
- If either argument is not of a recognized numeric class, it will be
  treated as if it was a `Double` for the rest of this algorithm.
- If both arguments are approximations to real numbers `(Float`,
  `Double`, or `BigDecimal`), the result will be the wider type.
- If both arguments are integers `(Boolean`, `Byte`, `Character`,
  `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, or `BigInteger`), the result will be the
  wider type.
- If one argument is a real type and the other an integer type, the
  result will be the real type if the integer is narrower than "int";
  `BigDecimal` if the integer is `BigInteger`; or the wider of the
  real type and `Double` otherwise.

## Interpreting Objects as Integers

Operators that work only on integers, like the bit-shifting operators,
treat their arguments as numbers, except that `BigDecimal`s and
`BigInteger`s are operated on as `BigInteger`s and all other kinds of
numbers are operated on as Longs. For the `BigInteger` case, the result
of these operators remains a `BigInteger`; for the `Long` case, the
result is expressed as the same type of the arguments, if it fits, or as
a `Long` otherwise.

## Interpreting Objects as Collections

The projection and selection operators (`e1.{e2}` and `e1.{?e2}`), and
the `in` operator, all treat one of their arguments as a collection and
walk it. This is done differently depending on the class of the
argument:

- Java arrays are walked from front to back
- Members of `java.util.Collection` are walked by walking their
  iterators
- Members of `java.util.Map` are walked by walking iterators over
  their values
- Members of `java.util.Iterator` and `java.util.Enumeration` are
  walked by iterating them
- Members of `java.lang.Number` are "walked" by returning integers
  less than the given number starting with zero
- All other objects are treated as singleton collections containing
  only themselves

## OGNL Language Reference

This section has a fairly detailed treatment of OGNL's syntax and
implementation. See below for a complete table of OGNL's operators, a
section on how OGNL coerces objects to various types, and a detailed
description of OGNL's basic expressions.

### Operators

OGNL borrows most of Java's operators, and adds a few new ones. For the
most part, OGNL's treatment of a given operator is the same as Java's,
with the important caveat that OGNL is essentially a typeless language.
What that means is that every value in OGNL is a Java object, and OGNL
attempts to coerce from each object a meaning appropriate to the
situation it is used in.

The following table lists OGNL operators in reverse precedence order.
When more than one operator is listed in the same box, these operators
